# Who am I?

## Hi

I have no idea what to really write in an introduction. Anytime I've had to I get this overwhelming sensation of really cringey introduction speeches from those movie characters who you know are going to befall some terrible fate.
But I'll try:

I'm Alex, or Umbra, or even AbstractUmbra - whichever you prefer.

I'm a DevOps engineer by trade, still pretty early in that career (I don't even use Kubernetes yet), and I'm still trying to find my passion I think.
I enjoy a lot of things but I wouldn't say any of them fill me with an overwhelming sense of *me*?

- I play games, of no specific genre. I'm not wonderful at any, just passably good. If I had to list any I'd say (J)?RPG types are my favourite,
- I'm studying the Japanese language. This has been an overwhelming desire for years and I think I finally found the headspace to pursue it. Sadly my learning methods are slow.
- I program a lot. I know a fair amount of Python, and some Rust. I want to try Elixir sometime but I think I should focus on a handful, not a basketful of things.

There's probably more but my mind is drawing a blank at the moment.

You can get my GitHub and Steam from my [Socials](/links) and if you're interested you can view my [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/users/AbstractUmbra) profile for my Japanese progress.

よろしくおねがいします！！
